Patch Management issue: 

Given your Laravel `CachePatchService` and `downloadCombinedPatches()` logic, here’s a breakdown of **why the timeouts happen** and **how to fix or optimize it**.

---

## ⚙️ How This Works (and Why It’s Slow)

### 🔹 What `combinePatchesForDownload()` does

When a client requests `/admin/cache/patches/download-combined`, this method:

1. Queries **all `CachePatch` rows** newer than `from_version`.
2. Opens **each patch’s `.zip` file**.
3. Iterates over **every file** inside each zip.
4. Reads the file bytes (`getFromIndex`) and writes them to a **new combined ZipArchive**.
5. Streams that back as a file download.

That means **every request physically reconstructs a huge zip file** on disk — even if it’s already been built before.

## 💥 Problem on Shared Hosting

On FastComet shared hosting:

* PHP is limited to **~512 MB RAM**, **1 CPU core (fractional)**, and **~30–60 s max execution time**.
* I/O and temporary file creation (in `/tmp` or `storage/app/cache`) are slow.
* Multiple users share the same CPU, so concurrency kills performance.

So 10 clients hitting this route in parallel → 10 expensive zip builds → all processes hit the I/O and CPU wall → **timeouts**.

## ✅ Fixes / Optimizations

### 1. 🧠 **Cache combined patches**

Don’t rebuild the combined zip each time.

Modify your method like this:

```php
public function combinePatchesForDownload(string $fromVersion): ?string
{
    $latestVersion = CachePatch::getLatestVersion();
    $combinedZipPath = "cache/combined/from_{$fromVersion}_to_{$latestVersion}.zip";

    // ✅ Reuse cached version if already exists
    if (Storage::exists($combinedZipPath)) {
        return $combinedZipPath;
    }

    // (rest of your existing logic...)
}
```

That way, subsequent downloads just stream an existing file — almost instant.

---

### 2. 📦 **Serve zips statically**

If you move combined zips into `/public/cache/combined/`, you can bypass PHP entirely:

```php
return response()->file(public_path("cache/combined/from_{$fromVersion}_to_{$latestVersion}.zip"));
```

Even better: use a direct Nginx or Apache rewrite to that folder.
