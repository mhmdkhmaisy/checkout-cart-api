Ah — now I see exactly the problem. This is a classic **patch delta / base patch management problem**. Let me break it down and outline an efficient strategy for shared hosting without fancy server modules.

---

## 🔹 Current Problem

You have:

* Base patch: `1.0.0 → 1.0.1` (200 MB compressed)
* Delta patches: `1.0.1 → 1.0.2` (50 MB), etc.
* When a user with no cache downloads everything:

  * Your server currently creates a “combined” patch on the fly: `0.0.0 → 1.0.2`
  * Resulting ZIP = 200 MB + deltas = 200+ MB, possibly repeated for multiple versions.
* Each new delta increases combined patch size if generated dynamically.

**Consequences:**

1. Big files every time — high bandwidth usage.
2. Disk I/O heavy on shared hosting (you said only 6 MB/s).
3. Users download a lot of redundant data.
4. Dynamic combination is slow and CPU heavy without `X-Sendfile` or nginx.

---

## 🔹 Goals

1. Minimize **bandwidth per user**.
2. Avoid dynamic “rebuild” of combined patches on every request.
3. Keep storage manageable.
4. Work on **shared hosting** with only `public/patches` static serving.

---

###  Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Shared Hosting)

1. Keep **base + deltas** stored as static files.
2. Generate **only one “latest combined” patch** for users who have nothing.
3. All subsequent deltas remain **separate**.

**Workflow:**

| User State               | Download Strategy                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| New user (0.0.0)         | Download `latest_combined_0.0.0_1.0.2.zip` |
| Partial user (has 1.0.1) | Download only `delta_1.0.1_1.0.2.zip`      |
| Fully updated            | No download                                |

**Advantages:**

* New users still get one file → simple.
* Partial users download minimal deltas → low bandwidth.
* Storage impact is minimal (only one extra “latest combined” ZIP per major version).

## 🔹 Suggested Folder Layout (Static + Efficient)

```
public/patches/
├─ base_1.0.0.zip
├─ delta_1.0.0_1.0.1.zip
├─ delta_1.0.1_1.0.2.zip
├─ combined_0.0.0_1.0.2.zip  <-- latest combined for new users
```

* Always serve `combined_0.0.0_latest.zip` for new users.
* Serve **deltas only** for users with existing versions.

This way:

* Storage: ~1-2x the size of a base patch, not exponential.
* Bandwidth: minimal per user.
* No dynamic zip building → fast for shared hosting.

---

### 🔹 Implementation Notes

1. Keep a **manifest file** with:

```json
{
  "latest_version": "1.0.2",
  "patches": [
    {"from": "0.0.0", "to": "1.0.0", "file": "base_1.0.0.zip"},
    {"from": "1.0.0", "to": "1.0.1", "file": "delta_1.0.0_1.0.1.zip"},
    {"from": "1.0.1", "to": "1.0.2", "file": "delta_1.0.1_1.0.2.zip"},
    {"from": "0.0.0", "to": "1.0.2", "file": "combined_0.0.0_1.0.2.zip"}
  ]
}
```

* Client uses manifest to download only **required files**.
* Easy to extend for future deltas.

2. Optional: automate **combined patch generation** when a major release occurs:

* Only generate `combined_0.0.0_latest.zip` → serve to new users.
* Old combined patches can be deleted periodically.

---

✅ **TL;DR**

* **Do NOT generate combined patches on-the-fly per request** on shared hosting.
* **Static storage + manifest** approach is the safest and fastest.
* **New users:** download prebuilt combined file.
* **Existing users:** download only deltas.
* Saves bandwidth, CPU, and disk I/O.

when creating new patch instead of deleting the existing combined and making a new one with new patch combined (200MB+) for 5MB more or less~ of new content, do:
Incremental ZIP update and update combined name to new latest

Open the existing combined ZIP in append mode

Add or replace files from the new delta using a ZIP library:

PHP example (ZipArchive):
$combined = new ZipArchive;
$delta = new ZipArchive;

$combinedFile = storage_path('patches/combined_0.0.0_latest.zip');
$deltaFile    = storage_path('patches/delta_1.0.2_1.0.3.zip');

if ($combined->open($combinedFile) === true && $delta->open($deltaFile) === true) {
    // Loop over all files in delta
    for ($i = 0; $i < $delta->numFiles; $i++) {
        $filename = $delta->getNameIndex($i);
        $contents = $delta->getFromIndex($i);

        // Delete old file if exists
        $combined->deleteName($filename);
        // Add new file
        $combined->addFromString($filename, $contents);
    }
    $combined->close();
    $delta->close();

    // Optional: rename combined to latest version
    rename($combinedFile, storage_path('patches/combined_0.0.0_1.0.3.zip'));
}


✅ Pros:

Only writes the new/updated files

Keeps existing files in combined ZIP

Central directory is correctly updated

Works on shared hosting

⚠️ Cons:

PHP still decompresses/recompresses files individually (small cost, usually fine for 5 MB deltas)

Requires enough free disk space for temporary operations
