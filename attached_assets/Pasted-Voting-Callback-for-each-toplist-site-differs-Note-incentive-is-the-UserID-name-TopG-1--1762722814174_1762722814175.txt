Voting Callback for each toplist site differs:

Note*: {incentive} is the UserID/name

TopG:
1. Set your Postback URL (on TopG):
https://YOURDOMAIN/postback.php
To set this link use Edit Settings option from your server page.
The name of file postback.php is just an example and it's not mandatory, feel free to name it as you like.

2. Update your voting link and add parameter to the end:
https://topg.org/CATEGORY/server-SITEID-PARAMETER
Your TopG voting link should have an extra - and PARAMETER on end. Copy the LINK from Voting Code and add -USERNAME or -123456 or whatever you keep track of (PARAMETER can be only numbers, letters and _ ). For example if I want to check if username `Razor` votes or not I make the link https://topg.org/CATEGORY/in-SITEID-Razor.

3. Our response:
TopG will call your site after voting and the callback will look like this link:
https://YOURDOMAIN/postback.php?p_resp=PARAMETER&ip=USERIP
We sent you back the same PARAMETER and the call is made ONLY if the user has voted for you. Your postback.php should UPDATE at this point the user PARAMETER as Valid. In case he didn't voted we don't send any response.


Example:
How your voting link should look like for User ID (first) or Username (second):
https://topg.org/CATEGORY/server-SITEID-1234
https://topg.org/CATEGORY/server-SITEID-Razor
https://topg.org/CATEGORY/server-SITEID-changemetousername#vote (with Voting popup)

Our response, due first or second case, will be:
https://YOURDOMAIN/postback.php?p_resp=1234&ip=123.123.123.123
https://YOURDOMAIN/postback.php?p_resp=Razor&ip=123.123.123.123
Conclusion: The player with account id 1234 or username Razor has voted for you in case we called your postback link with parameter.
123.123.123.123 is the IP address used by the player to vote on Topg.

#Top100Arena:

Incentive Postback

How does incentive postback work?

When users come in to vote, you can append their ID (< 25 characters) to the voting page using the incentive GET variable:

e.g. https://www.top100arena.com/listing/xxx/vote?incentive=1000

When adding your listing, fill out the Incentive Postback field with the EXACT URL you want your user ID posted to:

e.g. http://www.yoursite.com/votingpage.php?postback=

You can do this when editing your listing, just log in to access it.

The result will be an HTTP request sent to:

e.g. http://www.yoursite.com/votingpage.php?postback=1000


#Rulocus (Runelocus):
1. Setting a Callback URL and Secret
The first step is providing us with a so-called “Callback URL”. This is a hidden page on your website which we will load (“call”) once a player has voted. You can provide your Callback URL in your server settings.

Additionally, you should set a Callback Secret – a unique key that we’ll send back with each callback to verify the request is legitimate. This protects you from potential abuse where someone might try to fake votes by calling your callback URL directly.

Note: Using Cloudflare? We recommend disabling it on your callback URL, as it might block the callback.

2. Send your players to your voting page at RULOCUS
While this step might seem straightforward, you do need to pay close attention. You’ll want to make sure the voting page URL has the right formatting, a correct example is:

https://www.rulocus.com/top-rsps-list/yourserver/vote?callback=CONTENTHERE
In the example above, the base URL is bold. You can find your server’s base URL in your account – it depends on your server name, as well as the gaming category your game is listed in.

We completed the base URL with “/vote?callback=CONTENTHERE“, you’ll need to do the same. The “CONTENTHERE” in our example can be anything unique of your choice, to help you identify your player (e.g. player name, session ID, IP address, etc). We will pass this back to your Callback URL after a successful vote.

3. Processing successful votes on your system
For this example, we will use the following callback URL: https://www.yourdomain.com/voteprocessing

We send the following variables to your callback URL (using both $_POST and $_GET):

callback – the aforementioned URL parameter (in our example “CONTENTHERE”).
ip – the voter’s IP address (might be useful for some servers).
secret – your callback secret key (if configured) for verification.
The final callback URL we would call is:
https://www.yourdomain.com/voteprocessing?callback=CONTENTHERE&ip=VOTERIP&secret=YOURSECRET


#RSPS-List:
How does Incentive Voting work?
You need a script on your server which we call once someone votes for you. See the php example for a basic integration based on the default callback below.

Default callback
This method works for most of our website users. Simply pass the voter username/id along with the vote link.

Place your callback url ( web accessable url of the script you created ) within your account settings.
Let your users vote using the following url
https://www.rsps-list.com/index.php?a=in&u=[RSPS-LIST-USERNAME]&id=[PlayerID]
You can pass any of the 3 following variables within the vote link. id=[PlayerID] or postback=[PlayerID] or incentive=[PlayerID]
Replace [RSPS-LIST-USERNAME] with your username on https://www.rsps-list.com.
Replace [PlayerID] with the ID that you identify your player with.
Dynamic callback
On some systems, you might need some more fine control or need to pass extra dynamic variables back to your callback script. In that case you could use this method.

In such a case, you can either completely drop the id, postback or incentive parameters and pass your own user parameter, or extend your link with a callback parameter.

https://www.rsps-list.com/index.php?a=in&u=[RSPS-LIST-USERNAME]&callback=[base64_encode]
In this method you need pass a base64_encode url, which includes whatever you need in your callback url
Replace [RSPS-LIST-USERNAME] with your username on https://www.rsps-list.com.
Replace [base64_encode] with a url, encoded with php's base64_encode() along with urlencode() to make it safe for url handling.
$callback_url = urlencode(base64_encode('https://mysite.com/callback_script.php?user=voter_username&extra_parameter=some_value'));
echo 'https://www.rsps-list.com/index.php?a=in&u=[RSPS-LIST-USERNAME]&callback='.$callback_url;
What variables do we sent back to you?
Following variables are sent as $_POST and $_GET in both callback methods

secret - Used to validate the request came from RSPS-List. Either TEST when you use our test callback page in developement, or YOUR_API_SECRET which you can find in your dashboard when switching into production.
voted - either 1 to indicate a successful vote or 0 for a failed/duplicated one.
userip - Contains the voters ip.
userid - If present, contains the voters username/ID as passed by you in your vote link via id=[PlayerID] or postback=[PlayerID] or incentive=[PlayerID].
custom - If present ( see dynamic callback ), holds reference to the base64_encoded string as passed by you via callback=[base64_encode]. Which you could decode to get your desired parameter if you only allow $_POST or ignore it and simply access your own parameters via $_GET

========================================================
These are the 4 top site I want to use, I already have /vote endpoint which dynamically creates a link with {sid} => siteVoteId and {incentive} => unique playerID.

currently the callback requires {uid} but not all toplists I want to use send one back. fix the callback to accommodate these toplists.

then create example Seeder (there's an existing one just modify it to follow the examples above)
