## What's Wrong

Your checkout is failing with error:
```
Foreign key constraint violation on order_items.order_id
```

**Root cause:** Your database tables are using MyISAM instead of InnoDB.
- MyISAM doesn't support transactions
- Order gets created but order_items can't see it within the transaction
- Foreign key constraint fails

**Evidence:** Order ID 37421 shows the auto-increment is corrupted.

## All Available Fix Methods

### Option 1: Interactive Fix (EASIEST)
```bash
php diagnose_and_fix.php
```
- Shows you what's wrong
- Asks before making changes
- Verifies everything worked
- **Recommended for most users**

### Option 2: Automatic Fix (FASTEST)
```bash
php fix_database_now.php
```
- Fixes everything immediately without asking
- Good if you trust the script completely

### Option 3: Laravel Artisan
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:diagnose
```
- Uses Laravel's migration system
- May not work if migrations weren't applied

### Option 4: Manual SQL
```bash
# View current status
mysql -u root -p rsps_donations < verify_foreign_keys.sql

# Then run these SQL commands:
ALTER TABLE orders ENGINE = InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE order_items ENGINE = InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE products ENGINE = InnoDB;

# Fix auto-increment (see CHECKOUT_ERROR_FIX.md for full SQL)
```

## After Fixing

### 1. Verify It Worked
```bash
php artisan db:diagnose
```
Should show: "✅ No issues found! Database is healthy."

### 2. Test Checkout
- Make a test purchase
- Check logs for success messages
- Order IDs should now be normal sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...)

### 3. Clear Cache
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
```
