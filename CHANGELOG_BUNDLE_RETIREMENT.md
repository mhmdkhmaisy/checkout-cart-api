# Bundle System Retirement - Changelog

## Date
October 14, 2025

## Summary
Retired the bundle system and integrated the patch functionality directly into the file manager view. The file manager and patch system now coexist on the same route (`/admin/cache`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Controller Updates

#### CacheFileController (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CacheFileController.php`)
- **Added patch data to `index()` method:**
  - `$patches` - All patches ordered by latest
  - `$latestVersion` - Latest patch version
  - `$basePatches` - Count of base patches
  - `$incrementalPatches` - Count of incremental patches
  - `$totalPatchSize` - Total size of all patches
  - `$canMerge` - Boolean flag for merge recommendation

- **Added patch management methods:**
  - `getLatestVersion()` - API endpoint for latest version info
  - `checkForUpdates(Request $request)` - Check for available updates
  - `downloadPatch(CachePatch $patch)` - Download specific patch
  - `downloadCombinedPatches(Request $request)` - Download combined patches
  - `mergePatches()` - Merge incremental patches into base
  - `deletePatch(CachePatch $patch)` - Delete a patch

### 2. Routes Updates (`routes/web.php`)

#### Removed Bundle Routes
- ~~`/admin/cache/bundles` (index)~~
- ~~`/admin/cache/bundles/{bundle}` (destroy)~~
- ~~`/admin/cache/bundles/clear-expired` (clear expired)~~
- ~~`/admin/cache/bundles/clear-all` (clear all)~~
- ~~`/admin/cache/bundles/{bundle}/download` (download)~~

#### Updated Patch Routes
All patch routes now point to `CacheFileController` instead of `CacheBundleController`:
- `/admin/cache/patches/latest` → `CacheFileController@getLatestVersion`
- `/admin/cache/patches/check-updates` → `CacheFileController@checkForUpdates`
- `/admin/cache/patches/{patch}/download` → `CacheFileController@downloadPatch`
- `/admin/cache/patches/download-combined` → `CacheFileController@downloadCombinedPatches`
- `/admin/cache/patches/merge` → `CacheFileController@mergePatches`
- `/admin/cache/patches/{patch}` (DELETE) → `CacheFileController@deletePatch`

### 3. View Updates

#### File Manager View (`resources/views/admin/cache/index.blade.php`)
- **Added complete patch system UI section** after the file browser:
  - Patch statistics cards (Latest Version, Base Patches, Incremental Patches, Total Size)
  - Merge recommendation alert (when threshold reached)
  - Patch chain visualization showing all patches with:
    - Version number
    - Type indicator (Base/Delta)
    - File count and size
    - Download and delete actions
  - Empty state message when no patches exist

### 4. Files That Can Be Deprecated

The following files are no longer in active use:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CacheBundleController.php` - All functionality moved to CacheFileController
- `resources/views/admin/cache/bundles.blade.php` - UI integrated into index.blade.php

**Note:** These files have been left in place for reference but are not actively used. They can be removed in a future cleanup.

### 5. Database & Models

No changes required:
- `CacheBundle` model - Still exists (data preserved)
- `CachePatch` model - Still exists and actively used
- All database tables remain intact

### 6. API Compatibility

All patch API endpoints maintain the same response format:
- `/admin/cache/patches/latest` - Returns latest version and patch list
- `/admin/cache/patches/check-updates` - Returns update availability and patch list
- Client-facing endpoints remain functional with same behavior

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Navigation** - Users no longer need to switch between separate views for file management and patch system
2. **Unified Interface** - File manager and patch system are now on the same page (`/admin/cache`)
3. **Reduced Complexity** - Eliminated redundant bundle system while keeping patch functionality
4. **Better UX** - Single cohesive view for all cache management tasks

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify file manager loads correctly at `/admin/cache`
- [ ] Verify patch statistics display correctly
- [ ] Test patch download functionality
- [ ] Test patch merge functionality
- [ ] Test patch deletion (non-base patches only)
- [ ] Verify API endpoints return expected data
- [ ] Test client update check flow

## Migration Notes

No database migration required. Existing bundles remain in the database but are no longer actively managed through the UI. The patch system continues to function independently.
