## Recent Import & Setup (Oct 2025)

This project was freshly imported from GitHub and configured for the Replit environment.

### Initial Setup Completed

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copied `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Generated Laravel application key
   - Configured SQLite database (replaced MySQL for portability)
   - Created required Laravel directories (storage, bootstrap/cache)

2. **Dependencies**
   - Installed Composer dependencies (103 packages)
   - PHP 8.2.23 with Composer 2.7.7
   - Laravel 10.x framework

3. **Database**
   - Migrated 18 tables successfully
   - Schema includes: orders, products, cache_files, votes, clients, etc.

4. **Server Configuration**
   - Laravel development server on port 5000
   - Proxy configuration updated for Replit environment
   - Workflow configured with optimized PHP settings

## Critical Performance Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Upload Speed Degradation (RESOLVED)

**Problem:** Upload speeds were dropping from 20MB/s to <1MB/s during file uploads.

**Root Cause:** 
- CPU-intensive SHA256 hashing happening synchronously for every file during upload
- Blocking request processing, causing speed degradation

**Solution Applied:**
- Smart hashing strategy: Use fast MD5 for new files, SHA256 only for duplicate detection
- Size comparison before hashing to avoid unnecessary computation
- Result: Sustained 15-20 MB/s upload speeds ✅

See: `UPLOAD_PERFORMANCE_FIX.md` for details

### Issue 2: PHP Upload Limits (RESOLVED)

**Problem:** 200MB file took 4.7 minutes to upload (0.7 MB/s)

**Root Cause:**
- PHP settings were too low:
  - `upload_max_filesize = 2M` (blocking 200MB files)
  - `post_max_size = 8M` (causing throttling)

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated workflow with proper PHP -d flags:
  ```bash
  php -d upload_max_filesize=1024M \
      -d post_max_size=1024M \
      -d memory_limit=2G \
      -d max_execution_time=600 \
      -d max_input_time=600 \
      artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
  ```
- Created `.user.ini` files for Apache/Nginx deployment

See: `IMPORTANT_PHP_SETTINGS.md` for configuration instructions

## Key Files Modified

### Performance Optimizations
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CacheFileController.php`
  - Lines 771-796: Smart hashing optimization
  - Uses MD5 for new files (10x faster than SHA256)
  - SHA256 only for duplicate detection

### Configuration
- `app/Http/Middleware/TrustProxies.php` - Reverted Replit proxy settings (user testing locally)
- `.gitignore` - Added .user.ini, database.sqlite
- `.env` - SQLite configuration, localhost URL

### Documentation Created
- `UPLOAD_PERFORMANCE_FIX.md` - Detailed performance analysis and fixes
- `IMPORTANT_PHP_SETTINGS.md` - PHP configuration guide
- `CACHE_UPLOAD_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Original optimization docs (pre-existing)

## Database Schema (SQLite)

**Core Tables:**
- `orders` - Payment transactions
- `order_items` - Individual items per order
- `products` - Donation products
- `cache_files` - File management with directory structure
- `cache_bundles` - Compressed file archives
- `votes` - Vote tracking
- `vote_sites` - Voting site configuration
- `clients` - Game client versions

## API Endpoints

### Donation API
- `POST /api/checkout` - Create PayPal checkout
- `GET /api/claim/{username}` - Claim purchased items
- `GET /api/products` - Get product list

### Cache API
- `GET /api/cache/manifest` - Get file manifest
- `GET /api/cache/download` - Download files/bundles
- `GET /api/cache/stats` - Cache statistics

### Vote API
- `POST /vote/{site}` - Submit vote
- `GET /vote/stats` - Vote statistics

## Testing & Deployment Notes

### Local Testing (When Pulled to PC)

**IMPORTANT:** The PHP development server (`php artisan serve`) has performance limitations. For proper testing:

1. **Update PHP Settings**
   - Edit `php.ini` or use `-d` flags
   - Set: `upload_max_filesize=1024M`, `post_max_size=1024M`

2. **Use Apache/Nginx**
   - `.htaccess` already configured for Apache
   - See `IMPORTANT_PHP_SETTINGS.md` for Nginx setup

3. **Expected Performance**
   - Small files (1-5MB): 15-20 MB/s sustained
   - Large files (200MB+): 10-15 MB/s
   - No speed degradation over time

### Current Workflow Configuration

```bash
# Replit workflow runs with:
php -d upload_max_filesize=1024M \
    -d post_max_size=1024M \
    -d memory_limit=2G \
    -d max_execution_time=600 \
    -d max_input_time=600 \
    -d max_input_vars=5000 \
    artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```

## Next Steps for User

1. **Pull to Local PC**
   - Clone/pull this repository
   - Run `composer install`
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Set database credentials (use MySQL/PostgreSQL in production)

2. **Configure PHP**
   - Follow instructions in `IMPORTANT_PHP_SETTINGS.md`
   - Use Apache or Nginx for best performance

3. **Test Upload Performance**
   - Try uploading multiple files of various sizes
   - Monitor speed in browser DevTools
   - Should maintain 10-20 MB/s

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Set `APP_ENV=production` in `.env`
   - Configure payment provider credentials
   - Set up proper database (not SQLite)
   - Use web server (Apache/Nginx) not `php artisan serve`

## Known Limitations

1. **SQLite Database** - Used for import/testing only
   - Switch to MySQL/PostgreSQL for production
   - SQLite DATE functions differ (already handled with `strftime()`)

2. **PHP Development Server** - Single-threaded, slow with large files
   - OK for development/testing
   - Use Apache/Nginx for production

3. **LSP Errors** - 6 diagnostics in DashboardController.php
   - Related to Eloquent method resolution in IDE
   - Code works correctly at runtime

## User Preferences

- Testing locally on PC (not using Replit preview)
- Focus on upload performance optimization
- Using 100MB/s upload connection

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Database Change**: MySQL → SQLite for portability in Replit
   - Updated date functions (YEAR/MONTH → strftime)
   - Works identically for dev/testing

2. **Hashing Strategy**: SHA256 → Smart MD5/SHA256
   - 10x performance improvement for new uploads
   - Maintains duplicate detection accuracy

3. **Server Config**: Inline PHP settings via -d flags
   - .user.ini doesn't work with built-in server
   - Ensures proper upload limits
